  abstract      = "This paper presents a systematic treatment of the linear
                   theory of scalar gravitational perturbations in the
                   synchronous gauge and the conformal Newtonian (or
                   longitudinal) gauge. It differs from others in the literature
                   in that we give, in both gauges, a complete discussion of all
                   particle species that are relevant to any flat cold dark
                   matter (CDM), hot dark matter (HDM), or CDM+HDM models
                   (including a possible cosmological constant). The particles
                   considered include CDM, baryons, photons, massless neutrinos,
                   and massive neutrinos (an HDM candidate), where the CDM and
                   baryons are treated as fluids while a detailed phase-space
                   description is given to the photons and neutrinos. Particular
                   care is applied to the massive neutrino component, which has
                   been either ignored or approximated crudely in previous
                   works. Isentropic initial conditions on super-horizon scales
                   are derived. The coupled, linearized Boltzmann, Einstein and
                   fluid equations that govern the evolution of the metric and
                   density perturbations are then solved numerically in both
                   gauges for the standard CDM model and two CDM+HDM models with
                   neutrino mass densities $\onu=0.2$ and 0.3, assuming a
                   scale-invariant, adiabatic spectrum of primordial
                   fluctuations. We also give the full details of the cosmic
                   microwave background anisotropy, and present the first
                   accurate calculations of the angular power spectra in the two
                   CDM+HDM models including photon polarization, higher neutrino
                   multipole moments, and helium recombination. The numerical
                   programs for both gauges are available at

               suitable for the advanced undergraduate or starting graduate
               level. Presenting the key theoretical foundations of cosmology
               and describing the observations that have turned the subject into
               a precision science, the author keeps the student in mind on
               every page by explaining concepts step-by-step, in an
               approachable manner. After describing the dynamics of the
               homogeneous universe, the book traces the evolution of small
               density fluctuations, which were created quantum-mechanically
               during inflation and are today observed in the cosmic microwave
               background and the large-scale structure of the universe. The
               book is ideally suited as a course companion or for self-study.
               With all necessary background material covered, students have
               everything they need to establish an unrivalled understanding of
               the subject. Complete with many worked examples, figures, and
               homework problems, this textbook is a definitive resource for
